# One-shot recovery for a broken self-hosted Supabase stack.
#
# Fixes three issues that prevent uploads / realtime / edge functions from working:
#   1. storage container restart loop ("must be owner of table buckets" /
#      "cannot drop function foldername because other objects depend on it")
#   2. realtime container ("invalid_schema_name: no schema has been selected to create in")
#   3. functions container ("worker boot error: failed to read path" — missing main dispatcher)
#
# Safe to re-run. Drops the broken storage schema (and any rows in
# storage.buckets / storage.objects) and rebuilds it from scratch by letting
# the storage container apply its full migration chain. Only run when storage
# was never fully functional — files on disk in the storage-data volume keep
# their bytes but their DB rows are wiped.
